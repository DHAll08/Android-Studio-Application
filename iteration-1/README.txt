Iteration-1 ReadMe:

For the first iteration of our project we decided to create the basic frame work of our moblie app. We did this in Andriod Studio,
using both Java and XML. The first Activity "which is like a page in Andriod Studio" we completed was the Main Menu. This Activity 
displays a number of amentities the user can look for using our app. Once an amenity is chosen the user is taken to a Building Selection,
where they're shown a campus map, as well as a list of buildings on campus that have that amenity. Once the user submits the building they
want, they're taken to a page that will list all of that amenity located in that building "something that will take conectting our app to 
the database which is in iteration 2". 

This iteration was completed on 11/1/16.
