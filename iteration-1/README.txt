Iteration-1 ReadMe:

For the first iteration of our project we decided to create 
the basic frame work of our moblie app. We did this in Andriod Studio,
using both Java and XML. The first Activity(i.e. "a page in Andriod Studio") 
that we completed was the Main Menu. This Activity displays a number of 
amenities the user can look for using our app. Currently, the amenities 
"Bathrooms" and "Computer Labs" are the clickable buttons. Once an amenity 
is chosen the user is taken to a Building Selection Activity, where they're 
shown a campus map, as well as a list of buildings on campus that have that 
amenity. Once the user submits the building they want, they're taken to a page 
that [in Iteration 2] will list all of that amenity located in that building. 
As of now, each new Activity states the data that was chosen in the previous 
Activity. 

This iteration was completed on 10/31/16.
