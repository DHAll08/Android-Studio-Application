Improvements on testing:
  We tried our best to break the application, but were unsuccessful. However, we had a few buttons that are for future iterations
  and upon selecting a couple of them, it wouldn't necessarily "break"/crash our application, but it did not contribute
  professionally to our "look and feel" for when it went to the next building selection page. We replaced going to the next 
  page, with a pop up message saying that the button would be implemented in the future. Therefore, while we weren't able to 
  break anything, our more in depth testing, with the motivation to break the application, made us realize some extra changes 
  that have made a huge difference in the presentation of our application.

Testing User Stories:
[X] On the final amenity listing page, a Home button is available which takes the user back to the first page.
[X] From the phone's list of applications, our application has it's own unique icon and a catchy name.
[X] Upon selecting a computer lab, text pops up saying how many computers are in that specific room.
