Improvements on testing:
  We tried our best to break the application, but were unsuccessful. Throughout this iteration, it broke
  plenty of time, but upon completion it worked perfectly, no matter what we did.

Testing User Stories:
[X] On the final amenity listing page, a Home button is available which takes the user back to the first page.
[X] From the phone's list of applications, our application has it's own unique icon and a catchy name.
[] Upon opening the application, a splash screen pops up with our logo for a small amount of time.
