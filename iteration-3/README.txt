For the third iteration, the major focus was on the "look and feel" of the application,
and making sure that it is user friendly. Our client wanted a "home" button on the final
page, that would allow the user to go back to the beginning without pressing the back
button multiple times. She also wanted a catchy launch icon, logo, and name for the application.
Finally, she wanted a splash page upon opening the application.

This iteration was completed on 12/2/16.
