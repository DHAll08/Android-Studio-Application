For the third iteration, the major focus was on the "look and feel" of the application,
and making sure that it was user friendly. Our client wanted a "home" button on the final
page, that would allow her to go back to the beginning without pressing the back
button multiple times. She also wanted a catchy launch icon and logo, as well as a decent name 
for the application. Finally, she wanted details on the computer labs (number of computers) 
to show upon selecting a computer lab from the AmenityList Activity page.

This iteration was completed on 12/2/16.
