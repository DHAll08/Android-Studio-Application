Improvements on testing:
  Testing seems to have gone very well so far, but we have yet to really try to "break" our application.
  Hopefully it is not possible, but we plan on attempting testing this time with the goal of breaking it.

Testing User Stories:
- On the final amenity listing page, a Home button is available which takes the user back to the first page.

- From the phone's list of applications, our application has it's own unique icon and a catchy name.

- Upon opening the application, a splash screen pops up with our logo for a small amount of time.
