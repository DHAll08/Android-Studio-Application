Meeting: 30 Nov 2016, 5pm
Attendees: Mike and Client

Fedback: The client was pleased with the application. Her suggestions for future improvements:
 - Clickable map for buildings with bathrooms/comp labs
 - food/charging stations/wifi - no drop down menu or submit button - just highlight locations on map
 - Home and Back buttons on each page, especially the last page
 - show more info about comp labs when clicked, like the bathrooms
 - name and logo for app
