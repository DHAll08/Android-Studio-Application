Project Desscription: Next-Bus App

The project that we are proposing is a web based "possibly moible" app. That would help the user find the nearest
bus stop, the time a bus should arive, given your location and route what bus to take, what buses to transfer to
and from, where your bus should be at the moment, and other bus related searches. The app would be local to the
Humboldt area, but could expand to other areas in the future.
