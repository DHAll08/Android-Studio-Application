Iteration-2 ReadMe:

For the second iterations, we rewrote our database using sqlite and inserted 
and queried data contained in it. Upon selecting a building from the dropdown
menu, a new activity(page) begins, listing all bathrooms/computer-labs within 
that building. Specifically for bathrooms, among selecting one, more information 
about it will pop up. In Iteration 3 we hope to insert and query extra information 
on computer labs (the number of computers) as well.

This iteration was completed on 11/27/16.
