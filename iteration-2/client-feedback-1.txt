Meeting: 12 Nov 2016
Attendees: Entire team, and client (Yonaly)

Fedback: Yonaly said that what we had so far was "awesome", she liked
         the simple and straight forward layout, and she liked what our plan
         was for iteration 2. She suggested for implementing amenities of 
         bathrooms, to use symbols next to the unique bathroom listings
         (like a handicap symbol if it's handicap accessible).
